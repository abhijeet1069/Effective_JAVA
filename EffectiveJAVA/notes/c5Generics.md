# Generics

List<E> (read "list of E")

Generics allow the author of a class or method to introduce type parameters, which are symbols that can be substituted 
for any concrete type.

## Benefits

Eliminates cast
Provides stronger checks at compile time

## Naming convention

Although, we can use any variables, we use following convention:

1. 'E' - Element
2. 'K' - Key
3. 'N' - Number
4. 'T' - Type
5. 'V' - Value
6. 'S','U','V' - 2nd, 3rd and 4th types

## Prefer lists to arrays

## Prefer annotations to naming patterns
